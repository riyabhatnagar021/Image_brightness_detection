# Image_brightness_detection

<b> Basic Idea </b>

Certain regions of images will be selected to pickup the brightness level and finally averaging those value will give the average brightness level of the image.

Step 1: Run img_bright.ipynb

Once the imgage is entered and code has run successfully. the Output will be like this:

Perhaps lets check for another image:

Finally after Running all the cells, The Score of the brightness will be printed:
